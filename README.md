# Quantifying the quality of Smart Energy Solutions via testing

This repository contains educational material given in conjunction with the summer school "Quantifying the quality of Smart Energy Solutions via testing", held at the Technical University of Denmark in August 2018.

This summer school was arranged in connection with the European Horizon 2020 project ERIGrid (www.erigrid.eu).
The primary authors of the material given here are Daniel Esteban Morales Bondy (DTU), Karen Pardos Olsen (DTU), Cornelius Steinbrink (OFFIS), with contributions from Tue Vissing Jensen (DTU).

The notebooks are split into two parts:
The first part introduces the co-simulation framework Mosaik (https://mosaik.offis.de/), and shows how to build _scenarios_ in this framework out of pre-coded units (directory scenario_build_up).
The second part analyzes these scenarios by applying _Design of Experiments_ methods to scenario parameters (directory DoE-Exercises).

Background and a suggested reading/execution order are given in "ERIGrid\_Summer\_school\_2018.pdf".

## Using these notebooks

Each directory contains one or more notebooks (.ipynb) which take the user through mosaik scenarios and design of experiments techniques.

Each set of notebooks require specific python packages, as represented in their individual requirements.txt files.

For more information on how to run the notebooks, see, e.g., https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/ .
