# Jupyter notebook for learning how to build simulation scenarios in mosaik

The main file to open in this directory is the Jupyter Notebook called "scenario\_build\_up.ipynb". The notebook was made using Jupyter version 4.4.0, and Python 3.6. The requirements for running the notebook itself can be found in the file "requirements.txt". 

The requirements can be installed with pip through:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

If you use Anaconda to manage your Python environment and don't want to mix the use of ``pip`` and ``conda``, you can install each package manually using, e.g.:

``conda install pandas``

Note: Mosaik is not on the Anaconda repository, you will have to install it from ``PyPI``, e.g. with ``pip``.

These educational notebooks have been developed by Karen Pardos Olsen, Daniel Esteban Morales Bondy, and Tue Vissing Jensen, all at the Technical University of Denmark, with the support of the H2020 ERIGrid project, Grant Agreement No. 654113
